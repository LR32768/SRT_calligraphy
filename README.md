# SRT_calligraphy
SRT project of evaluating and optimizing Chinese characters calligraphy. 
This project includes loading the character as monochronic graph to 0-1 matrix and refine it to get better pattern.
Futhermore, we feed these patterns to CNN to get the best range (interval) of these parameters.
